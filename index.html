        <h3 class="subtitle">As a Programmer</h3>
        <p>I am a video game developer specializing in Unreal Engine and C++, with experience in porting games to different platforms. Additionally, I am a technician in molds, matrices, and devices, which allows me to approach problems with both technical and creative mindsets. My background in electronic engineering strengthens this approach, helping me tackle projects from a broad and innovative perspective.</p>
  
        <h3 class="subtitle">Related to Teaching</h3>
        <p>Although my experience in teaching video game development is recent, it has allowed me to combine two of my great passions: technology and teaching. I enjoy sharing my knowledge of Unreal Engine and C++ with future developers, watching them progress and overcome challenges. Moreover, as a scuba diving instructor with over 7 years of experience, I continue to share this beautiful activity, both at recreational and professional levels.</p>
  
        <h3 class="subtitle">My Personality</h3>
        <p>I love facing new challenges, whether in the classroom or underwater, and seeing the happiness on my students' faces after completing a class is one of my greatest rewards. For me, teaching is a constant opportunity to learn and grow alongside my students.</p>
